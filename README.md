# Paramount Combat Armaments
Paramount Combat Armaments mod for Rimworld

This mod adds several new guns, apparel and buildings designed to take advantage of CE and vanilla mechanics while filling in niches in the vanilla lineup in a way that the included items are both balanced and reasonably stronger than the other modded options in the workshop.
